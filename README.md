## Features
- Multiple layout styles
  - Tiling (i3/sway-like)
  - Binary Space Partitioning (bspwm-like)
  - Master-stack (dwm-like)
  - Scrolling columns (niri-style) <details> <summary><sup>note</sup></summary>when using multiple displays and the scrolling layout, displays must be arranged in a vertical stack or windows may leak into other displays due to displays all existing in the same coordinate space</details>
  - Stack (accordion)
- Menubar icon that opens a menu for switching workspaces, changing layouts, and accessing quick Rift controls <details> <summary><sup>click to see the menu bar icon</sup></summary><img src="assets/menu_menu.png" alt="Rift menu bar icon" /></details>
- Save and restore layouts from the menu bar or CLI, with reusable layouts listed from a configurable folder <details> <summary><sup>click to see the menu</sup></summary><img src="assets/menu_layouts.png" alt="Rift menu for restoring layouts" /></details>
- MacOS-style mission control that allows you to visually navigate between workspaces <details><summary><sup>click to see mission control</sup></summary><img src="assets/mission_control.png" alt="Rift Mission Control view" /></details>
- Focus follows the mouse with auto raise
- Drag windows over one another to swap positions
- Performant animations <sup>(as seen in the [demo](#rift))</sup>
- Switch to next/previous workspace with trackpad gestures <sup>(just like native macOS)</sup>
- Hot reloadable configuration
- Interop with third-party programs (ie Sketchybar)
  - Requests can be made to rift via the cli or the mach port exposed [(lua client here)](https://github.com/acsandmann/rift.lua)
  - Signals can be sent on startup, workspace switches, and when the windows within a workspace change. These signals can be sent via a command(cli) or through a mach connection
- Does **not** require disabling SIP
- Works with “Displays have separate Spaces” enabled (unlike all other major WMs)

## Quick Start

## Display-scoped virtual workspaces
When multiple displays have independent virtual workspaces, target a display by
UUID instead of relying on Rift's implicit command context:

```sh
rift-cli execute workspace switch 1 --display-uuid <display-uuid>
rift-cli execute workspace move-window 1 --display-uuid <display-uuid>
rift-cli execute workspace move-and-follow 1 --display-uuid <display-uuid>
```

Use `rift-cli query displays` to find display UUIDs. Add `--follow`, or use
`workspace move-and-follow`, to switch to the destination workspace after the
move.

## Status
Rift is a stable, reliable, and performant window manager used by many. It is still in development and thus new features, optimizations, and general improvements are regularly released, but is more than good enough for daily use.

> Issues and PRs are very welcome.

## Community
Join the Rift community on Matrix for discussion, support, and announcements: [#rift:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#rift:matrix.org)

## Motivation
Aerospace worked well for me, but I missed animations and the ability to use fullscreen on one display while working on the other. I also prefer leveraging private/undocumented APIs as they tend to be more reliable (due to the OS being built on them and all the public APIs) and performant.

## Credits
Rift began as a fork (and is licensed as such) of <a href="https://github.com/glide-wm/glide">glide-wm</a> but has since diverged significantly. It uses private APIs reverse engineered by yabai and other projects. It is not affiliated with glide-wm or yabai.
