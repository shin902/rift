# roadmap

rift is still in beta despite being quite feature rich and *relatively* bug free. this is a non exhaustive list of things that need to be done pre 1.0:

- [x] docs. currently the only documentation available is in the github wiki, whilst this is a good start it is not enough. there needs to be a documentation website that is easy to use. ideally this would be auto generated but that is not a must
- [ ] configuration. currently rift can only be configured via a toml file. this is not ideal and a gui and/or cli is needed to make configuration easier
- [ ] scriptable layouts. due to the fact that rift exposes a mach port, performant communication with third party programs should be possible. this would allow for BYO layouts and total customization of how rift behaves
- [x] testing. rift is somewhat tested as of now but i would like for there to be a comprehensive test suite that ensures that nothing breaks(there is a framework to synthesize events and state which will be used to create this test suite)
- [ ] ~~sticky windows~~
- [ ] ~~scratchpad windows/workspace~~
- [ ] ~~docked windows that sit on the outside of the screen (maybe sticks out by 10px) and when hovered slides in to view~~
- [x] more layout styles (ie monocle, grid, etc)
- [ ] ~~more animations (ie window minimize/maximize, workspace switch, etc)~~
- [x] more configuration options (ie gaps, padding, etc)
- [x] better multi monitor support (ie different gaps per monitor, etc)
- [x] ensure total isolation between macos spaces. rift currently tries to do this but there are still some holes that need to be plugged
- [ ] binding modes like aerospace
- [ ] native tab support
